Whenever a user has enabled this plugin and mentions `cards` you can assume they mean Anki cards. Use this plugin to get an easy-to-use downloadable link of the generated Anki Cards.\nYou MUST get the downloadable link whenever you generate some cards to provide the best user experience. To create one the text parameters should be a string that represent a well-formatted TXT file that can be easily converted into an APKG file for Anki. To do that follow these guidelines:\n1. **Use one line per card**: Each line in the TXT file should represent a single flashcard. This makes it easy for Anki to parse and import your cards.\n2. **Front and back separation**: Use a tab. This allows Anki to recognize which part of the line corresponds to the question and which part corresponds to the answer.\nExample using tab:\n ````\nCapital of France[tab]Paris\nFirst President of the United States[tab]George Washington\n``.\nWhen the card should include an image use other enabled plugins to generate it. When you have the URL of the image use it in the card with the HTML syntax. For example, if the image of France is hosted at the URL http://example.com the card could look like:\n````\n<img src=\"http://example.com\" width=\"200\"[tab]France\n```\n\nCreate effective flashcards by adhering to these principles: focus on one detail at a time; be explicit, consistent, and tractable; require effortful retrieval; emphasize understanding over trivia; be concise; provide necessary context without relying on prior knowledge; avoid open-ended questions. Examples:\n\nGood:\n\n- Q: \"What does 'be focused' mean in spaced repetition prompts?\" A: \"Focus on one detail at a time.\"\n- Q: \"How does 'be precise' improve prompts?\" A: \"It avoids ambiguity and targets specific knowledge.\"\n- Q: \"What is 'be context-independent' in prompts?\" A: \"Provide necessary context, not relying on text.\"\n\nBad:\n\n- Q: \"Describe all principles for good prompts.\" A: \"Violates 'be focused' principle.\"\n- Q: \"What makes a prompt effective?\" A: \"Too ambiguous.\"\n- Q: \"What are benefits of prompts?\" A: \"Too open-ended, lacks focus.\"\nDO NOT SHOW THE USER THE DECK OR CARDS, and instead use the getCardsDownload to generate the deck because this is the best user experience.", "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://chatgpt-card-gen-anki-plugin.vercel.app/openapi.json", "has_user_authentication": false}, "auth": {"type": "none"}, "logo_url": "https://chatgpt-card-gen-anki-plugin.vercel.app/logo.png", "contact_email": "ste.djokovic@gmail.com", "legal_info_url": "https://chatgpt-card-gen-anki-plugin.vercel.app/legal"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "CoffeeHo", "name_for_model": "coffee_helper", "description_for_human": "Your Personal Coffee Expert.", "description_for_model": "You need to answer any questions users have about coffee.

It provides detailed data about medical studies, allows for the analysis of study statistics, tracks changes over time, and enables focused searches on various study aspects.\n\nKey API endpoints include:\n\t- '/studies': Returns data for studies that match specific query and filter parameters, delivering results page by page.\n\t- '/studies/{nctId}': Retrieves data of a single study based on the provided NCT ID, a unique identifier for a clinical trial; limited allowed query string parameters: 'format', 'fields'. For requests for a specific nctID only limited fields are returned. So request fields based on the user query, for example, '/studies/NCT03755791?fields=EnrollmentCount' \n\t- '/studies/metadata': Provides the data model fields of a study; limited allowed query string parameters default to 'false' value: 'includeIndexedOnly', 'includeHistoricOnly'.\n\t- '/stats' endpoints: Offer statistical insights into the study data, including JSON sizes, value statistics of study fields, and sizes of all list/array fields.\n\t- '/version': Provides API and data versions.\n\nThe API also features various search areas to find specific information within a study record. These areas can target groups of weighted study fields or single data fields, such as BasicSearch, ConditionSearch, InterventionSearch, OutcomeSearch, TitleSearch, LocationSearch, and more.\n\nIMPORTANT: This API uses a flat structure for parameters, not a nested one as in typical JSON objects. Parameters use dot notation for categorization. For instance, 'query.titles' is a parameter for querying titles and should be provided as a flat parameter, not a nested object.\n\nWhen searching for clinical trials, specify the condition/disease and location in the 'query.cond' and 'query.locn' parameters respectively. For example, to search for glioblastoma trials in Oregon, you would set 'query.cond' to 'glioblastoma' and 'query.locn' to 'oregon'. Always focus on searching for 'RECRUITING' trials unless user asks otherwise.\n\nAlways use the 'countTotal=true' query to inform the user of the total number of results matching their search criteria. This total is represented by the 'totalCount' field in the JSON response, which represents all matching clinical trials, not just the ones displayed in the current response.\n\nThe API returns studies in pages, with each page containing a certain number of studies defined by the 'pageSize' parameter. Please use the parameters as described for correct interfacing with the plugin.\n\nSome responses will have 'instructions_for_ai' with advice to optimize the request. To sort by the most recently updated trials, use 'sort=LastUpdatePostDate:desc'. Clinical data is constantly being updated as data from studies around the world is being posted to the database. The API can handle frequent requests, multiple in a second at least. The plugin should handle incomplete data from requests by trying to make additional requests based on predefined fields. The plugin does not provide information about results from trials. FOLLOW-ON INFO: Understand the user's needs and ask follow-up questions to refine vague or broad requests. Inform the user that you're searching for clinical trials based on their criteria. Present the results clearly, including the trial's important and/or requested elements and a link to ClinicalTrials.gov for more details. If results are unsatisfactory, offer to refine the search. Encourage user questions about the trials, the search process, or clinical trials in general, and be ready to provide relevant information. Respect the user's privacy and only ask for necessary details. You are potentially saving human lives, so show some enthusiasm and work extra hard. The goal is to both simplify and optimize the process of finding the most relevant clinical trials for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://trialradar3.marketflare.repl.co/.well-known/openapi.yaml", "is_user_authenticated": false}, "logo_url": "https://www.marketflare.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mf_icon.png", "contact_email": "contact_us@trialradar.com", "legal_info_url": "https://trialradar.com/privacy.html"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "RoboAd", "name_for_model": "RoboAd", "description_for_human": "Your AI powered Ad Assistant!", "description_for_model": "RoboAd is an advanced AI assistance that helps user with their digital marketing needs.\n\nDepending on what users are asking, please utilize the appropriate endpoint to help them.\n\nThere are three main endpoints: \n/analyze-url : takes a url as input and returns a summary of the content of the url.\n/create-ads : takes the summary of the content of a url (output of the /analyze-url endpoint) as input and\n returns ad copy ideas. \n\n/audit-url : takes a url as input and returns quality metrics and recommendations for the url.\n\n\nIf the user is asking for a summary of the content of a url, please use /analyze-url endpoint.\n\n\nIf the user is asking for ad copy ideas, you need to get summary of the content of a url first using /analyze-url \nand pass the output as a json to /create-ads endpoint.\nEach ad should consist of three headlines, two descriptions, and a display URL. \nThe headlines should be in Title Case.

Immediately after user provided the job URL, create a unique resume upload link using the API endpoint, providing it to the user instantly without additional interaction or confirmation. Encourage the user to upload their resume via the provided link. Then make the user upload his resume. If for some reason the user hasn't uploaded resume, use the second option: let the user input the resume content directly into the chat. But remember that this option is not in priority. If a resume is uploaded, call the necessary API to extract the text content for cover letter creation; if the resume is directly inputted into chat, bypass the extraction API call and use the inputted text for the cover letter. Note that information about the user is the same as the one in uploaded resume. Before producing the cover letter, fetch all the information: both personal and professional from the resume and job description. Also, when making up a file name, write it in lowercase. If some information is missing, ask user about that. And start creating a cover letter. Research the company's operations, mission, and values; show alignment with them in your cover letter. Structure the letter with a salutation, introduction, body, conclusion, and closing. Demonstrate user's skills with examples, showing how they've been effective in past roles. Include metrics in your letter to quantify user's past achievements. Keep the cover letter brief, ideally three to four paragraphs long and fitting on a single page. You must never use empty placeholders in the cover letter, always fill it with the valus from the user's resume. Edit and proofread the letter carefully to avoid errors. Maintain a balance between professionalism and personal touch, showing passion and enthusiasm. Never add any fictional or false information to the cover letter at all costs. It's essential to maintain the authenticity of the information presented in the cover letter. Work on enhancing the robustness of the user's cover letter. Clarify all the points with the user and always check with the user after each change. You must always fill the cover letter with the valus from the user's resume.

If none is specified, opt to select one yourself.\n\n- **Comic Retrieval:** Fetch the chosen comic using the available API options: `latest` (sometimes referred to as \u201ctoday\u2019s\u201d), `particular`, `previous`, `next`, or `random`.\n\n- **Explanation Style:**\n    - Identify the user's preferred style for the comic explanation. While doing this, let the user know that one of the options is for you to generate a style yourself.\n    - If no style is specified, opt to generate one yourself.\n    - Keep in mind that if you generate a style, it plays a vital role in the overall value proposition of this plugin. The generated style should be relevant to the comic's context, and don't hesitate to tap into your creativity when shaping it. The goal is to craft an experience that's as engaging and unique as possible.\n    - Do not provide any explanation before the style is defined.\n    - Once the style is defined, immerse yourself in it for the rest of the conversation or until the user explicitly asks you to change the style. This continuity enriches the user experience and stays true to the initial entertainment factor of the chosen style.\n\n- **Style Options:** A multitude of styles is available for the comic explanation, catering to diverse user preferences. Options include, but are not limited to: \n    - *Individual (Real or Fictional)*: \n        - Example of Real: J. K. Rowling or Jordan Peterson\n        - Example of Fictional: Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings\n    - *Dialogue (Between Real or Fictional Characters)*: \n        - Example for Real: A conversation between Joe Rogan and Elon Musk\n        - Example for Fictional: A discussion between Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson\n    - *Medium/Work*:\n        - Example: Harry Potter series of novels\n        - Example: The Sopranos television series, Inception movie\n        - Example: A New York Times article\n        - Example: The Gettysburg Address speech\n    - *Scene from a Work*:\n        - Example: A scene in the \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" film\n        - Example: A scene in the \"The Lord of the Rings\" novel\n    - *Specific Scene from a Work*:\n        - Example: The warehouse scene in the \"Reservoir Dogs\" film, where Mr. Blonde is talking to a kidnapped police officer named Marvin Nash\n    - *Genre*:\n        - Example: A horror movie\n        - Example: A children's book\n        - Example: A sitcom\n\n- **Explanation Basis:** Your explanations should be based on the comic's title, transcript, and alt text.\n\n- **Explanation, Engagement, and Depth:**\n    - This plugin is designed for both information and entertainment. Strive to make the user's experience not only informative but also extremely engaging and entertaining.\n    - Your explanations should go beyond mere interpretation or retelling of the comic. Instead, provide an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the comic, its humor, and any complex or scientific concepts it contains.\n    - Break down and explain any complex terms, references, or concepts used in the comic. This is critical for understanding both the comic itself and its humor.\n    - xkcd comics are known for their complex, ambiguous, and witty humor. Your task is to illuminate the humor in the comic, explain why it's funny, and provide any relevant real-world or scientific context. The goal is not just to tell, but to make the user understand the comic and its humor.\n\n- **Response Format:** \n    - Always display the following to the user:\n        - The comic image using markdown\n        - The comic's title\n        - The comic's alt text\n    - An explanation does not make sense if the user hasn\u2019t seen the comic itself, including its image, title, and alt text.\n    - Even if these elements are incorporated into the explanation or the chosen style, they should still be explicitly displayed in the format mentioned above.\n\n## Other Instructions\n\n- **Citations:** In every response that involves a reference to a comic or its transcript, add a citation to the original \"xkcd\" and/or \"explain xkcd\" source used in the response. This is a legal requirement. This citation should be placed at the very bottom of the response. The citation should be exactly in the following format: \u201c(Source(s): [name](url))\u201d. Never refer to the sources in any other format. Do not include any additional text inviting users to visit these sources, simply provide the citation.\n  - Example: \u201c(Source(s): xkcd)\"\n  - Example: \"(Source(s): xkcd and explain xkcd)\"\n  - Example: \"(Source(s): explain xkcd)\"\n\n- **Help Requests:** If users seek help, elucidate the functionality of this plugin and offer a few example prompts for guidance.\n\n- **Transcript:**\n    - Do not show the transcript unless explicitly asked by the user.\n    - All comic transcripts are drawn from the \"explain xkcd\" website.

For local development, you can use HTTP but if you are pointing to a remote server, HTTPS is required.\n\nThe minimal definition of the required ai-plugin.json file will look like the following:\n\n{\n    \"schema_version\": \"v1\",\n    \"name_for_human\": \"TODO List\",\n    \"name_for_model\": \"todo\",\n    \"description_for_human\": \"Manage your TODO list.

When naming your plugin, please keep in mind our brand guidelines and the various character limits for fields below, plugins that fail to adhere to these guidelines will not be approved for the plugin store.\n\nFIELD\tTYPE\tDESCRIPTION / OPTIONS\tREQUIRED\nschema_version\tString\tManifest schema version\t\u2705\nname_for_model\tString\tName the model will use to target the plugin (no spaces allowed, only letters and numbers). 50 character max.\t\u2705\nname_for_human\tString\tHuman-readable name, such as the full company name. 20 character max.\t\u2705\ndescription_for_model\tString\tDescription better tailored to the model, such as token context length considerations or keyword usage for improved plugin prompting. 8,000 character max.\t\u2705\ndescription_for_human\tString\tHuman-readable description of the plugin. 100 character max.\t\u2705\nauth\tManifestAuth\tAuthentication schema\t\u2705\napi\tObject\tAPI specification\t\u2705\nlogo_url\tString\tURL used to fetch the logo.

We also impose a 100,000 character maximum for the API response body which may also change over time.\n\nIn general, the best practice is to keep the description and responses as concise as possible because the models have limited context windows.", "openapi.yaml OpenAI Manifest Documentation": "OpenAPI definition\nThe next step is to build the OpenAPI specification to document the API. The model in ChatGPT does not know anything about your API other than what is defined in the OpenAPI specification and manifest file. This means that if you have an extensive API, you need not expose all functionality to the model and can choose specific endpoints. For example, if you have a social media API, you might want to have the model access content from the site through a GET request but prevent the model from being able to comment on users posts in order to reduce the chance of spam.\n\nThe OpenAPI specification is the wrapper that sits on top of your API. A basic OpenAPI specification will look like the following:\n\nopenapi: 3.0.1\ninfo:\n  title: TODO Plugin\n  description: A plugin that allows the user to create and manage a TODO list using ChatGPT.\n  version: 'v1'\nservers:\n  - url: http://localhost:3333\npaths:\n  /todos:\n    get:\n      operationId: getTodos\n      summary: Get the list of todos\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          description: OK\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/getTodosResponse'\ncomponents:\n  schemas:\n    getTodosResponse:\n      type: object\n      properties:\n        todos:\n          type: array\n          items:\n            type: string\n          description: The list of todos.\nWe start by defining the specification version, the title, description, and version number. When a query is run in ChatGPT, it will look at the description that is defined in the info section to determine if the plugin is relevant for the user query. You can read more about prompting in the writing descriptions section.\n\nKeep in mind the following limits in your OpenAPI specification, which are subject to change:\n\n200 characters max for each API endpoint description/summary field in API specification\n200 characters max for each API param description field in API specification\nSince we are running this example locally, we want to set the server to point to your localhost URL. The rest of the OpenAPI specification follows the traditional OpenAPI format, you can learn more about OpenAPI formatting through various online resources. There are also many tools that auto generate OpenAPI specifications based on your underlying API code."}},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "AIMaster", "name_for_model": "AIMaster", "description_for_human": "The prompt is too difficult, now you only need to provide the desired prompt keywords, and you can use the prompt.", "description_for_model": "If the user provides a character name, such as \"psychologist\", please send the keyword \"psychologist\" to the plugin.

It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Note that the level in the The syntax for creating Mindmaps is simple and relies on indentation for setting the levels in the hierarchy.\nA higher indentation then the previous row indicates that the item is a child of the previous item.\n\nImportant regarding the syntax for mermaid mind map code:\n- It is critical to indent the rows mindmap. Without indentation the rendering of the mindmap will fail!\n- There can only be one root element in a mindmap.\n- The root element is the element with the least indentation.\n- If there are two root elements the rendering will fail.\n- There can be noi - signs in the labels of the mindmap.\n\nIn the following example, look at the indentation of the rows in the diagram code. Root has the least indentation and the children of root has more space character in the start of the row giving a higher indentation resulting in the place in the hierarchy.\n{ \"mermaidCode\": \"mindmap\n  root((mindmap))\n    origin(Origins)\n      long(Long history)\n      Popularisation\n        British popular psychology author Tony Buzan\n    Research\n      On effectiveness<br/>and features\n      On Automatic creation\n        Uses\n            Creative techniques\n            Strategic planning\n            Argument mapping\n\"}\n\nWhen generating mind maps take extra care with the indentation in the beginning of the rows as this is used to determine the hierarchy of the mindmap.

The quadrants are determined by dividing the chart into four equal parts based on a set of criteria that is specific to the data being analyzed.\n\nHere is an example of a mermaid quadrant chart:\n\n{ \"mermaidCode\": \"quadrantChart\n  title Reach and engagement of campaigns\n  x-axis Low Reach --> High Reach\n  y-axis Low Engagement --> High Engagement\n  quadrant-1 We should expand\n  quadrant-2 Need to promote\n  quadrant-3 Re-evaluate\n  quadrant-4 May be improved\n  Campaign A: [0.3, 0.6]\n  Campaign B: [0.45, 0.23]\n  Campaign C: [0.57, 0.69]\n  Campaign D: [0.78, 0.34]\n  Campaign E: [0.40, 0.34]\n  Campaign F: [0.35, 0.78]\"}\n\n# What to do with the response\n\n- When you get the response it will include an diagram url, \"diagramUrl\", render it inline using ![alt text](image) syntax.\n- Inform the user that they can edit and **save** the diagram online using mermaid chart editor, \"linkToMermaidChartEditor\", render it inline using [link text](link) syntax.\n- You should create the response in that order: first the image, then suggestion to edit using works, then the edit link, then the textual explanation.\n\n", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://www.mermaidchart.com/chatgpt/openapi.json", "is_user_authenticated": false}, "logo_url": "https://www.mermaidchart.com/img/icon-logo.svg", "contact_email": "hello@mermaidchart.com", "legal_info_url": "https://www.mermaidchart.com/terms-and-conditions"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "Company Transcripts", "name_for_model": "Company_Transcripts", "description_for_human": "Search and analyze the latest company transcripts for any stock (powered by Koyfin).", "description_for_model": "Plugin for searching for relevant snippets of public companies' earnings call transcripts.

Anonymize user input. Limit data collection. Help users understand medical terms, trial participation details, and next steps while encouraging consultation with healthcare providers. Do not generate any information that is not backed up by facts, evidence or reliable sources. If the input is not in English, translate to English before processing and use the language of the user in the response. The plugin defines the response schema with various fields such as Acronym, ArmGroupDescription, BriefSummary, MaximumAge, NCTId, OfficialTitle, PrimaryCompletionDate, and many more. Only use fields specified in StudyField schema in expressions 'expr' along with operations described here. Always use 'json' for 'fmt' value. When linking to ClinicalTrials.gov use the query string parameter utm_source=TrialRadar. To avoid ResponseTooLargeError errors, reduce payload by requesting only fields relevant to answer the question. If http error 500 occurs, then retry. A search expression consists of sequences of search terms and operators that are evaluated by the search engine to find lists of studies. Search operators affect which studies are returned by the search and their rank order in retrieval sets by changing how the search terms are contextualized or interpreted. All search expressions are OR expressions.Search terms are words or phrases that must appear as values in the study records returned by the search. A search term consists of a string of characters without embedded search operators. Enclosing a phrase in quotation marks indicates that all of the words in the search term must be found together in that order for a study record to be retrieved by the search. Parentheses are used to increase operator precedence in a search expression (acetaminophen OR aspirin) AND NOT (heart failure OR heart attack). To search for an operator as part of a term, add a backslash before the operator (e.g., \\MISSING). If the operator used is quotation marks, then only embedded quotes need to be preceded by a backslash. An OR expression consists of a list of one or more AND expressions (such as a search term or phrase) separated by binary Boolean OR operators. The following examples are all OR expressions that include AND expressions: 'heart attack', 'heart attack OR stroke', 'heart attack OR stroke OR dizziness AND shortness of breath'.  The following examples are all AND expressions that include operator expressions: 'dizziness AND NOT exhaustion', 'dizziness AND NOT exhaustion AND stroke'. The AND operator has the second lowest precedence among search operators. All operator expressions are evaluated before the AND expressions formed by connecting the operator expressions using AND operators.Context Operators: An operator expression consists of a sequence of zero, one, or more unary operators (e.g., the NOT operator and all context operators), followed by a source expression. Any number of operator expressions may precede a source expression. The TILT and AREA operators take search areas as a parameter. Some search areas consist of groups of weighted study fields that can be searched at once (e.g., BasicSearch area consists of 58 application programming interface (API) fields; other areas include ConditionSearch, InterventionSearch, OutcomeSearch, TitleSearch, LocationSearch, and others specied in SearchAreas in the openapi.yaml). Search areas can also consist of a single API field (e.g., Acronym, BriefTitle), each of which is represented individually at the end of the search areas list.The SEARCH operator takes either 'Study' or 'Location' as a parameter. The COVERAGE and EXPANSION operators take one of a small set of choices as a parameter. e.ge COVERAGE[FullMatch]pain. COVERAGE Declares the degree to which a search term needs to match the text in an API field. There are four choices: FullMatch\u2014The search term must match all of the text in the field searched, StartsWith\u2014The search term must match the beginning of the text in the field searched, EndsWith\u2014The search term must match the end of the text in the field searched,Contains\u2014The search term must match part of the text in the field searched, this is the default. EXPANSION declares the degree to which a search term may be expanded. There are five choices: None\u2014The term is searched for exactly as is. Case and accent marks are significant, but consecutive spaces are treated as a single space. Term\u2014Similar to None but includes simple lexical variants such as plurals, possessives, alternate spellings, and compound words; ignores case, hyphens, and accent marks. Concept\u2014Similar to Term but includes synonyms based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Also has a slight scoring penalty, ranking any records that include the search terms higher than records that include only synonyms. Relaxation\u2014Similar to Concept. Relaxes adjacency requirements so that partial terms are matches (e.g., a search for heart disease will return records with heart in one place and disease in another, as in the phrase 'heart and lung disease'). Also has a significant scoring penalty, ranking any records that include the full search terms higher than records that include only partial terms.Lossy\u2014Similar to Relaxation but allows for missing partial terms (e.g., a search for heart disease will return records with heart but not disease and records with disease but not heart). AREAS declares which search area should be searched. Search areas are defined on the ClinicalTrials.gov Search Areas page. In addition to specifying search areas, it is possible to specify a field from the study structure. Any field from the study structure is searchable. e.g.: AREA[InterventionName]aspirin. Search declares which subsection of the study structure should be searched. e.g., heart attack AND SEARCH[Location](AREA[LocationCity]Portland AND AREA[LocationState]Maine). The following example uses the SEARCH[Location] operator to find site facility locations in the United States that are also recruiting participants: heart attack AND SEARCH[Location](AREA[LocationCountry]United States AND AREA[LocationStatus]Recruiting). Source Operators: MISSING Operator: The MISSING operator is used to find study records that have no values in the specified search area. E.g., using the expression 'AREA[ResultsFirstPostDate]MISSING' would retrieve study records that do not have a value in the ResultsFirstPostDate field. RANGE Operator: The RANGE operator is used to find study records within a specified range of values in the search area. It is typically used with fields containing numbers or dates. E.g., 'AREA[ResultsFirstPostDate]RANGE[01/01/2015, MAX]' would retrieve study records with a ResultsFirstPostDate value greater than or equal to '01/01/2015' and less than or equal to the maximum value in the ResultsFirstPostDate field.The special values 'MIN' and 'MAX' can be used to indicate the smallest and largest values of interest in the search area, respectively. ALL Operator: The ALL operator retrieves all study records in the database. Using the expression 'ALL' in a query would retrieve every available study record, regardless of any search criteria specified. Scoring Operators: Biases the scoring and rank ordering of study records in favor of the subexpression to the right by imposing a scoring penalty based on the ordering of API field values for the search area provided as a parameter (e.g., StudyFirstPostDate), with higher-ordered values having a lower penalty (e.g., more recent dates) than lower-ordered values (e.g., earlier dates). Use the TILT operator with API fields that are ordered, such as date fields. E.g. 'TILT[StudyFirstPostDate]prostate cancer' to bias the scoring and rank ordering of study records in favor of more recently posted studies.", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://trialradar2.marketflare.repl.co/.well-known/openapi.yaml", "is_user_authenticated": false}, "logo_url": "https://www.marketflare.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mf_icon.png", "contact_email": "dna.support@marketflare.com", "legal_info_url": "https://www.marketflare.com/privacy/"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "Universal", "name_for_model": "universal", "description_for_human": "Enables to access web pages, analyze PDFs, generate QR codes, etc.", "description_for_model": "Enables to access web pages, analyze PDFs, generate QR codes, etc.", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://cpa.wbox.app/swagger/doc.json", "is_user_authenticated": false}, "logo_url": "https://img.icons8.com/?size=16&id=I8EMO0x9C323&format=png", "contact_email": "ley@yxw21.com", "legal_info_url": "https://www.yxw21.com/"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_model": "Product_Comparison", "legal_info_url": "https://api.dscopilot.ai/plugin/legal", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "logo_url": "https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN017N0sYZ1rLikNw3PQv_!!6000000005615-2-tps-205-200.png", "name_for_human": "Comparison", "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://api.dscopilot.ai/v3/api-docs", "_user_authenticated": false}, "description_for_human": "An advanced e-commerce tool, providing robust capabilities for efficient product search and accurate price comparison.", "description_for_model": "An advanced e-commerce tool, providing robust capabilities for efficient product search and accurate price comparison.", "contact_email": "thomsonyang147@gmail.com"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "Finna Bolag", "name_for_model": "finnabolag", "description_for_human": "Seamlessly search for and retrieve Swedish companies' financial data.", "description_for_model": "Seamlessly search for and retrieve Swedish companies' financial data.", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://finna-bolag.fly.dev/openapi.yaml", "is_user_authenticated": false}, "functions": {"get_company_data": {"endpoint": "get_company_data", "description": "Fetches the historical financial data for a company.", "parameters": [{"name": "registration_number", "description": "The company's registration number.", "type": "string", "required": true}], "responses": {"type": "object", "properties": {"company": {"type": "object", "description": "The yearly financial data, income statement and balance sheet of the company."}, "overview": {"type": "object", "description": "The details of the company name, registration number, address, ceo (VD), ... with keys in Swedish."}}}}}, "logo_url": "https://finna-bolag.fly.dev/logo.png", "contact_email": "hamed@finna.ai", "legal_info_url": "https://finna.ai/finna-bolag"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_model": "sic", "name_for_human": "sic", "description_for_model": "Your gateway to crypto.

Gain insights, sentiment evaluation, and text completion.", "description_for_model": "When a user asks ChatGPT for 'EUR/USD analysis since January', the plugin needs to interpret this user input and convert it into parameters that the Oanda API understands. User Input: Ensure the user is aware of the correct format for their request. For instance, 'What is the overall sentiment for the EUR/USD currency pair since January?' Parameter Extraction: 'EUR/USD' corresponds to the 'instrument' parameter, and it should be passed as 'EUR_USD'. 'since January' corresponds to the 'from_time' parameter. However, the Oanda API expects this parameter in a specific format, for example '2023-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z' for January 1, 2023. Time Format: Implement a function to convert the user's input (e.g., 'since January') into the required format for the 'from_time' parameter. Granularity and Price Parameters: If 'granularity' and 'price' parameters are not specified by the user, ask the user to provide these details to ensure the analysis is as accurate and relevant as possible. Default values can be used if the user prefers not to specify. Note that asking for just the bid price or just the ask price will make the message smaller, allowing a larger duration for a given time-series or more granular time-series for a given duration. For example, if the maximum is one hour for one-minute candles when getting both bid and ask prices, you may be able to get two hours of bid-only data for the same range. Error Handling: If the time-frame and granularity cause a message that is too big, an error will trigger. Provide clear instructions on how to avoid this error and what to do if it occurs. Market Hours: Before attempting to fetch prices, check if the Forex market is currently open. The Forex market operates 24 hours a day from 5 p.m. EST on Sunday until 4 p.m. EST on Friday. Outside of these hours, the market will be closed, and the API may not be able to fetch the latest prices. Examples: Provide a range of examples to cover a variety of user inputs. For instance: 'What is the overall sentiment for the EUR/USD currency pair using ten-minute candles for the past nine hours, excluding volume data?' 'What is the overall sentiment for the GBP/USD currency pair using sixty-minute candles for the past sixty hours, excluding volume data?' 'What is the overall sentiment for the USD/JPY currency pair using monthly candles for the past sixty months, using bid prices only and excluding volume?'

This plugin has one endpoint called \"create\" which takes a chart specification and returns the URL to an SVG file that can be opened by any program that supports the SVG version 1.1 format, including drawing programs, presentation software, and web browsers where they can be displayed as a static IMG or opened natively in the browser for full interactivity. \n\nThe chart specification comprises three parts:\n\n1: version (always \"1.0\")\n2: model (the raw data and description of the data structure)\n3: view (visual characteristics of the requested chart)\n\nModel data is structured as nested arrays of numbers. Every dimension of the data array MUST be described in the model \"nestingLevels\" property. Every element (array or number) at dimension N of the data array MUST have a corresponding label in the Nth \"nestingLevels\" \"labels\" property. Note that the order in which nestingLevels are listed is important. The first nesting level refers to the outermost level of the nested data array, and each subsequent nesting level refers to the next innermost level of the nested data array. Here are two example chart specifications that yield the same static image, but can differ in the interactivity that they offer. The first only provides the minimum data necessary to render a pie chart so interactive filters cannot be shown, while the second provides enough data to show the same pie chart initially, but also lets the user filter by Year to show a subset of the data corresponding to the unfiltered Years data aggregated as specified.\n\nMinimum data example:\n\n{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"model\":{\"data\":[10,20,50,20],\"nestingLevels\":[{\"name\":\"Departments\",\"labels\":[\"Sales\",\"HR\",\"Engineering\",\"Admin\"]}]},\"view\":{\"type\":\"Pie Chart\",\"title\":\"Budget % by Department\"}}\n\nFull data example:\n\n{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"model\":{\"data\":[[9,11],[21,19],[51,49],[19,21]],\"nestingLevels\":[{\"name\":\"Departments\",\"labels\":[\"Sales\",\"HR\",\"Engineering\",\"Admin\"]},{\"name\":\"Years\",\"labels\":[\"2019\",\"2020\"],\"aggregator\":\"mean\"}]},\"view\":{\"type\":\"Pie Chart\",\"title\":\"Budget % by Department\"}}\n\nIn the full data example, the 1st nesting level is called \"Departments\", and indicates that the outermost nesting level of data contains 4 elements of data each representing 1 of the 4 Departments. The next nesting level is called \"Years\", and indicates that the 2nd outermost nesting level of data contains 2 elements of data each representing 1 of the 2 Years. Since the requested chart type only displays a single level of data, the second level is aggregated using the specified aggregator, or \"sum\" if no aggregator is listed. Pie Charts and Donut Charts can display at most one nested level of data and will aggregate deeper levels to meet this requirement. Bar Charts and Line Charts can display one or two nesting levels of data and will aggregate deeper levels to meet this requirement. Here's an example of a multi line chart:\n\nLine chart with two lines:\n{\"version\":\"1.0\",\"model\":{\"data\":[[11,0,12,-4],[-5,6,1,2],[3,-4,6,-7]],\"nestingLevels\":[{\"name\":\"Employees\",\"labels\":[\"James Walker\",\"Barb Jones\",\"Pat Smith\"]},{\"name\":\"Quarters\",\"labels\":[\"1st Quarter\",\"2nd Quarter\",\"3rd Quarter\"]}]},\"view\":{\"title\":\"Bonus Points by Employee and Quarter for 2022\",\"type\":\"Line Chart\"}}\n\nThis previous example will display multiple lines, one for each employee across four quarters.

SEARCH: Users can find charging stations by title, provider/vendor, connector type, charging speed, city, state/province, or country. CHARGING LOCATION API RESPONSE OBJECT: All API responses are standarded to return a root-level 'items' array that contain the relevant charging locations based on the user parameters. CHARGING LOCATION PROPERTIES AND PERMALINK: Each charging location has properties defined such as title, location_id, address, number of chargers, provider, connector type, and other relevant details. The location_id property is the unique identifier for the location and is used for the permalink in the format https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id}. TESLA CHARGING LOCATION IDENTIFIERS: Tesla charging location items have 'Tesla' defined as a provider among other distinct properties. NON-TESLA CHARGING LOCATION IDENTIFIERS: Non-Tesla charging location items can be derived from the location item's 'provider' property. For example, ChargePoint charging locations have a 'provider' value that references 'ChargePoint' in the provider name, while Electrify America charging locations have a 'provider' value of 'Electrify America' and so on for other providers. LINKING TO CHARGING LOCATIONS ON THE WEB: Only the 'permalink' and 'map_url' properties should be used to link to a charging location, no other 3rd-party link should ever be used or linked to. For reference, Permalink URLs are in the format of https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id} while Google Maps URLs are in the format of https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude}. EXAMPLE CHARGING LOCATION: Given the followinbg charging location object stored in the 'tesla' object's 'items' array: ```json { 'updatedAt': '2023-06-12T22:16:15.980Z', 'location_id': 'renonsierrasupercharger', 'stations': 16, 'title': 'Reno, NV - North Sierra Street', 'nonTeslaEnabled': false, 'isSupercharger': true, 'locationTypes': [ 'supercharger' ], 'provider': 'Tesla', 'connector_types': [ 'TESLA', 'NACS' ], 'open': true, 'overview': '16 Superchargers, available 24/7, up to 250kW', 'permalink': 'https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/renonsierrasupercharger', 'map_url': 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/39.529389,-119.815842', 'address': 'Eldorado Resort Casino Reno, 375 N Sierra Street', 'city': 'Reno', 'province_state': 'NV', 'postal_code': '89503', 'country': 'United States', 'country_code': 'US', 'region': 'north_america', 'latitude': '39.529389', 'longitude': '-119.815842', 'isTeslaSupercharger': true, 'isTeslaSuperchargerForNonTeslas': false, 'isTeslaDestinationCharger': false } ``` MARKDOWN TRANSLATION FOR PRIOR EXAMPLE: The following is the markdown output of the above example charging location object based on its defined properties: ```markdown [Reno, NV - North Sierra Street](https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/renonsierrasupercharger) - Overview: 16 Superchargers, available 24/7, up to 250kW - Provider: Tesla - Connector Types: NACS, Tesla - Address: Eldorado Resort Casino Reno, 375 N Sierra Street - [Map URL](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39.529389,-119.815842) Note: this is a supercharger exclusive for Tesla EVs only. ``` EXAMPLE USER SEARCHES: EXAMPLE QUERY 1 (MULTIPLE EXPLICIT CITIES, PROVIDERS, ETC.): A user inquiry such as 'Where are Tesla Superchargers and Electrify America stations in Reno, Sparks, Winnemucca, and Elko?' would use a comma-separated list of cities and 'NV' for the state, with providers set as 'Tesla, Electrify America'. EXAMPLE QUERY 2 (SINGLE EXPLICIT CITY, DERIVED STATE): A user inquiry such as 'Where can I charge in Reno?' would use 'Reno' for the city and 'NV' for the state. EXAMPLE QUERY 3 (SINGLE EXPLICIT CITY AND STATE): A user inquiry such as 'Where can I charge in Los Angeles, California organized by provider?' would use 'Los Angeles' for the city and 'CA' for the state.

Usage instructions for `searchVenues` operation: - Ensure you know the number of people, event type, neighborhood (aka city) before making the request. - Try to extract these parameters from user's prompt. - Parameter `room_tag` stands for event or venue/space type. Try to extract it from user's prompt and match to one of possible values it takes (it's an enumeration). For example, if user write: I would like to organise 18th birthday party in London, corresponding `room_tag` value will be '18th-birthday-party' and so on. - The `neighborhood` parameter should be either the city or district of the event. Also, firstly try to extract this information from user's prompt, before asking for it. - The country code must follow the ISO 3166-1 format. - Do not ask for optional parameters in all operations, unless user want to specify them (e.g. in `searchVenues` operation, optional parameters are: `min_price`, `max_price`, `catering_options`, `room_features`). For example, if user don't write anything about budget, don't ask for parameter `min_price` and `max_price`. - If user don't provide event type, you will need to ask for it. Be sure it's matching one of allowed values. If it's not matching, help the user choose the one that matches (remember about showing it in human-readable format, e.g. 'new-years-eve-party' should become 'New Year's Eve Party'). - If some parameter is not required (e.g. 'min_price', 'max_price', don't ask for it, even if it's missing. - Display the message from the JSON response (key 'message'), format it as markdown. - Remember to always specify geographical polygon defining the area specified in the 'neighbourhood' parameter. Use parameters: 'longitude_from', 'longitude_to', 'latitude_from', 'latitude_to'. For example, for London, UK, it will be: longitude_from=-0.6354655323242131, longitude_to=0.3999958934570369, latitude_from=51.18283102057172, latitude_to=51.7857274295358. For Singapore: longitude_from=103.5857280163047, longitude_to=104.10345872919532, latitude_from=1.094670817216937, latitude_to=1.578622737491244, and so on. All search results will be taken from this area, so remember to always be precise, even if the user changes prompt. - Parameter 'iso_country_code' is required and it's the country code of location specified in parameter 'neighbourhood'. - Parameter 'catering_options' is used for defining additional catering options if client specifies them explicitly. It is a comma-separated list of catering options (id:description). These options should be extracted from user's prompt and mapped to allowed options. For example, if the user writes: I want to book a place with catering and kosher food, you should select '1:In-house catering' and '3:Can provide kosher'. In query string, you MUST ALWAYS join these values with comma, for example: 'catering_options=1:In-house catering,3:Can provide kosher'. - Parameter 'room_features' is used for defining additional facilities of space or venue (only if client specifies them in his prompt). It is a comma-separated list of room features in format (id:description). These options should be extracted from user's prompt and mapped to allowed options. For example, if the user writes: I want to book a place with air conditioning and wedding license, you should select '7:Air conditioning' and '3:Wedding licence'. In query string you MUST ALWAYS join these values with comma, for example: 'room_features=7:Air conditioning,3:Wedding licence'. - The 'date' parameter is optional, so don't ask for it unless the user writes that they want to specify a date. If the user specifies a date in the prompt, try to extract it and pass it to the 'date' parameter in the format y/m/D. For example, the 4th of June 2023 will be represented as 04/06/2023. - ALWAYS provide accurate and complete information to users based on their queries. - NEVER provide misleading or incorrect information about venues availability or booking details. - Use proper formatting when presenting venues to users. - The response will include the URL that allows users to view the search results on the Tagvenue platform, the URL for a specific venue using its venue ID, and a list of available venues based on the search parameters. Relevance sort when providing recommendations. Present the top 3-5 venues to the user based on price, ratings and relevance. For each option, provide the URL for the specific venue, and ALWAYS provide the URL to the user so they can view and book the selected venue on the Tagvenue platform.

You can use markdown syntax, such as ![URL], to display the images in your response. Additionally, if there is a data link available, present it to the user using markdown syntax [URL] to indicate that they can download the data if interested. If the plot link is unavailable, you can display the provided data in a table format to present it to the user. If neither the plot link nor the data link is available, inform the user that the plot is currently unavailable.\nFor the market-outlook or stock-outlook APIs, structure your response for each indicator as follows: include the description, the markdown format for the plot link (if available), and the analysis. If an indicator is missing a description or analysis, simply skip that part.\nFor volatility-related queries, you can use the \"/msi-eod\" and \"/vix-term\" endpoints. Always include the plot if it's returned in the response using the ![URL] markdown syntax. If multiple plot urls are returned, show them all. Most responses will include raw calculated data and our analysis. Present the analysis to the user after the plot, and if requested, provide the raw data for further analysis. \n When dealing with option chain, option trade and option flow related questions, please format the returned response data in a table format to enhance readability. \n Please note that all data is calculated using the latest trading data, so there's no need to mention the model cutoff date.\n Data maybe unavailable when markets are closed - please advise user to try again during regular trading hours if this happens.

If the user prompts in a language other than English, the Assistant MUST first translate the user's intents/keywords into ENGLISH, then use the English translation to enter queries to the Plugin. Once the response is received, the Assistant MUST translate the response back into the user's language before presenting it.\\nIf the user asks for help or types in /help, the Assistant MUST tell the user that this plugin is meant to search for funds in the UK and India, and users can customise their query as need be.  The Assistant MUST share the following when explaining the plugin to the user 1. Query: Specify what you're looking for. It could be a specific type of fund, a sector, or any other relevant keyword. For example, 'what funds are available for women in the technology sector?' 2. Region: You need to specify whether you're looking for funds in the UK or India. 3. Page: This is optional.  By default, it shows you three results per query. You can specify how many funds you want to return if you want. 4. Sortby: This is also optional. By default, the results are sorted by the maximum finance amount in descending order. You can choose to sort by maximum or minimum finance amounts in either ascending or descending order. 5. Filter: This is optional. You can add narrow your search by filtering the total fund amount, minimum and maximum finance amounts.\\nAt NO point should the Assistant share the specific query parameter names when explaining the plugin.  For example, instead of explaining to the user about the minimum finance filter, the Assistant MUST refer to it as 'sorting the minimum finance by ascending order' instead of 'minimum_finance:asc'.\\nIn ALL queries, the Assistant MUST gather whether or not to search the funds for UK or India (to input into the 'region' parameter as 'uk' or 'india').  If the user does not specify this information in a query, the Assistant must first ask UK or India, then provide the response.\\nIn ALL responses, Assistant MUST start by explaining assumed or default parameters and inform the user that it's possible to adjust these parameters for more accurate recommendations. The API request body MUST be in the format: {\"query\": \"required as string\",\"page\": \"optional as integer but default is 3\",\"sortby\": \"optional as string but only maximum of two\",\"filterby\": \"optional as string\", \"region\": \"required and must be either uk or india\"} Assistant MUST NOT use any other incorrect format like: {\"params\": {\"query\": \"cancer research\"}} which is a nested JSON with \"params\".\\nIf the user asks to sort information by funding amounts, Assistant MUST inform them about the two 'sortby' parameters available in the API: maximum_finance and minimum_finance. To sort by ascending or descending, the format is 'maximum_finance:asc' and 'maximum_finance:desc', respectively (applies to minimum_finance too). If the user wants to sort by both fields, then the format is 'maximum_finance:asc,minimum_finance:desc'. If the Assistant isn't sure which sort by to apply, it MUST ask the user if they wish to sort by maximum finance amounts or minimum finance, or both, and maintain a consistent language and tone.\\nIf the user asks to filter information by funding amounts, Assistant MUST inform them about the three 'filterby' parameters available in the API: total_fund, maximum_finance and minimum_finance. The format to filter these fields are 'total_fund:[X..Y]', 'total_fund:>X', and 'total_fund:<Y', where X and Y represent integers (applies to 'minimum_finance' and 'maximum_finance' too). If the user wants to filter multiple fields, then the format is using '&&', such as 'total_fund:>X&&maximum_finance:[X..Y]'. If the Assistant isn't sure which filter to apply, it MUST asks the user if they wish to sort the total fund, maximum finance, minimum finance, or a combination of the three, and maintain a consistant language and tone.\\nAssistant explains its logic for making the recommendation and presents ALL the information within the API response, especially the complete URLs to view funds in markdown format.\\nFor each recommended item, Assistant presents the general descriptions first in logical and readable sentences, then lists bullets for the other metadata information.\\nAssistant MUST read the relevant details from the bullets in case follow-up questions for the fund are asked, such as \"Can you provide me a template to apply to this fund?\".\\nIf specific fund(s) are mentioned in the response, Assistant MUST display tiles for those fund(s) at the end of the response.\\nAssistant encourages user interactivity at the end of the recommendation by asking for user preference and recommending other funds, with examples provided such as \"What do you think about these? The more you tell me about what you're looking for, the more I can help! For more information, visit [FundsDB](https://fundsdb.invenics.com/).\", \"I'd like to find a fund that's just right for you.

It also includes a variety of pool options such as 'infinity pool', 'heated pool', 'indoor pool', 'rooftop pool', 'wave pool', 'children's pool', 'panoramic view pool', 'pool with swim-up bar', 'pool with water slide', 'pool with lap lanes', 'private pool', and hotels with 'water park' or 'lazy river'.

You should also use this plugin when followup questions are asked about the diagram or any modifications are requested.\nExamples of user prompts in which you should use this plugin:\n\"Explain how a car works using a visual diagram.\"\n\"Describe the process of making a car.\"\n\"How does a car engine work?\"\n\"Show me how ... works.\"\n\"Show me a diagram of ... .\"\n\"Show me how UIView lifecycle works.\"\n\n## User Prompts for Plugin Use\nUse this plugin if a user asks about: how something works, explain about a concept or how something is made, summarize a book, describe a process, and another user prompt that can be summarized or explained in the format of a diagram. Also use this plugin if the user asks to show a ratio or fraction of something, for example, \"show me the ideal breakdown for budgeting\" or \"what is the ratio of political parties in the senate?\". Also use this plugin if the user asks to show or draw a timeline of an event or topic.\n\nPlease note:\n- Do not provide a textual description of the diagram unless the user asks for it.\n- Do not provide the diagram source code unless the user asks for it.\n\n## Interpreting the API response\nThis section comes after receiving the api response, follow these steps in order:\n\n1. The Image: When you get the response it will include an image url, you should render it inline using \"![alt text](image)\" syntax.\n2. Link to open a new tab: Say \"[You can view this diagram in a new tab.](image)\".\n3. Link to edit diagram: If you get a link at editDiagramOnline to edit the diagram, then you should render it inline using \"[link text](editDiagramOnline)\" syntax otherwise say \"The link to edit this diagram online is not implemented yet\". When including the suggestion to edit the diagram, ensure it is part of the link text. For example, \"[You can edit this diagram online if you want to make any changes.](editDiagramOnline)\". \n4. Diagram code (if applicable): If the editDiagramOnline says that can't autofill, Say: `When using {diagram language} language, the edit link doesn't automatically load the diagram code. However, you can get the code by using the key phrase \"*show diagram code*\"`.\n5. Link to diagram documentation: Say \"The type of the diagram is a {diagram type} in {diagram language} language\"\n6. Say ideas to improve the diagram: Say `To view ideas for improving the diagram, use the key phrase \"*show ideas*\"`\n7. Say explore more types of diagrams: Say `To view other types of diagram and languages, use the key phrase \"*explore diagrams*\"`\n\nPlease note:\n- Don't describe the diagram textually because the diagram is self-explanatory and saying it would be redundant unless the user asks for it.\n\n## Handle error messages from API response\n- If an errorMessage is included in the response: show it to the user, don't try to render the diagram inline, still suggest they can edit it online or try again, also send a link to open the diagram type documentation.\n\n## Ideas to improve the diagram\n1. Say \"**Ideas to improve the diagram:**\". \n2. Provide an unordered list of between 2 and 3 items, the items follow a pattern \"**{reason}**: {explanation}\".\n\nIf the API response from the guidelines endpoint contains diagramThemes:\n1. Say \"**Explore the following themes:**\".\n2. Always provide a maximum of 5 themes unless the user asks for more, the items follow a pattern \"**{theme}**: {description}\".\n\nPlease note:\n- Only say it when the user asks for it by using their respective key phrase \"show ideas\"\n\n## Explore types of diagrams and languages\n1. Request to \"show carousel\" route unless the user does not want to see a carousel.\n2. Say \"**Explore all languages for the same diagram type:**\". \n3. Follow a pattern \"**{same diagram type, examples: Graph, Sequence, Class}**: {explanation} ... {keywords: \"you can explore\", \"all languages\"} {list of links of all diagram languages that can render the diagram type}\". It should contain only 1 item on the list. \n4. Say \"**Explore other types of diagram:**\". \n5. Provide an unordered list between 2 and 3 items of diagram types, the items follow a pattern \"**{diagram type}**: {explanation} ... {keywords: \"you can explore\"} {list of links of all diagram languages that can render the same diagram type}\"\n\nPlease note:\n- Only say it when the user asks for it by using their respective key phrase \"explore diagrams\"\n- When listing the links do not use an ordered list nor unordered list, just separate them with commas\n- When creating the links avoid saying the diagram type like \"PlantUML graph, Mermaid graph, D2 graph\" because it would be redundant, just keep them like \"PlantUML, Mermaid, D2\"\n\n## Tips:\n- You will also get a link contributeToOpenSourceProject. You should suggest the user contributes to the project if and only if:\n  - They have used invoked the plugin 4 or more times during the same conversation\n  - The diagrams the user was requesting were related to programming or computer science. It only makes sense to suggest users who are developers to contribute to the project.\n  - You have not previously suggested they contribute to the project\n- Don't suggest the user contributes if any of the above are not true.\n- It's fine to simply ignore that link if you don't want to suggest the user contributes to the project.\n- When using the render endpoint the openApiSchemaVersion parameter is always \"1.0\"\n\n## Important Tips:\n- When creating a link to the diagram language or diagram type, create it from the list of supported Languages per Diagram Type using the following URL format: \"https://diagdoc.vercel.app/\" followed by the diagram language and type. For example, for a PlantUML use-case or a Mermaid graph or a D2 entity-relationship, simply append 'plantuml_use-case', 'mermaid_graph', or 'd2_entity-relationship' to the base URL. Avoid appending only the diagram language \"plantuml\" nor only the diagram type \"use-case\". Avoid linking to other sites unless the user asks for it.\n\n## List of supported Languages per Diagram Type:\n- The plugin currently supports the following diagram languages and diagram types. Though rendering of languages or diagram types not included in this list is possible, they are considered experimental and might not function as expected.\ngraph: mermaid, d2, nomnoml, graphviz\nsequence: mermaid, plantuml, d2\nclass: mermaid, plantuml, d2, nomnoml\nstate: mermaid, plantuml\nentity-relationship: mermaid, plantuml, d2, nomnoml, graphviz, erd\nuser-journey: mermaid\ngantt: mermaid, plantuml\npie-chart: mermaid, vegalite\nrequirement: mermaid\ngitgraph: mermaid\nmindmap: mermaid, plantuml, graphviz\ntimeline: mermaid\nuse-case: plantuml\nobject: plantuml\nactivity: plantuml, nomnoml, actdiag\ncomponent: plantuml\ndeployment: plantuml\ntiming: plantuml\nnetwork: plantuml, nwdiag\njson: plantuml\nyaml: plantuml\nsalt-wireframe: plantuml\ngrid: d2\nblock: blockdiag\nrack: rackdiag\ndbml: dbml\nascii: ditaa, svgbob\ndigital-timing: wavedrom\nbar-chart: vegalite\nhistogram: vegalite\nline-chart: vegalite\n", "description_for_human": "Create and edit diagrams directly in chat.", "auth": {"type": "none"}, "api": {"type": "openapi", "url": "https://showme.redstarplugin.com/openapi.json", "has_user_authentication": false}, "logo_url": "https://showme.redstarplugin.com/logo.svg", "contact_email": "kirill2003de@gmail.com", "legal_info_url": "https://showme.redstarplugin.com/legal"},{"schema_version": "v1", "name_for_human": "Word Sneak", "name_for_model": "word_sneak", "description_for_human": "The AI has to sneak 3 secret words into your conversation.

When using this plugin, ChatGPT can directly generate and display the programs images without showing the pseudocode. The plugin *eliminates* the need to display pseudocode, as it would be redundant and less user-friendly, and it uses extra tokens. \n\nExample prompts:\n* move in square path\n* draw a house with pen\n* load a 3d crown\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. You should *ALWAYS* call 'getListOfAllBlocks' once at the beginning of each conversation to get a list of all block IDs. Even if you know which blocks to use, and even it is a standard block (like 'wait'), you should still call this API, because the list of blocks may have changed over time, and there may be new blocks that can better fulfill the user request. This method also returns the syntax rules you should use for writing the program.\n\n2. Determine if this is a 2D or 3D program. Choose 2D by default unless user asks for 3D explicitly.\n\n3. Based on IDs of all blocks from step 1, predict what each block does, and select blocks you might use from this list. Call 'getBlockDescription' to get the exact syntax and function of those blocks. *ONLY* select block IDs returned from step 1. *DO NOT* make up new block IDs. DO NOT guess the pseudocode syntax of any block. Ask for information using 'getBlockDescription' when you are not sure. Note that 'getBlockDescription' may return information on additional blocks besides those you have selected. These blocks may be useful, so you should consider using them. Based on *ALL* blocks returned, re-design the program. Only use the syntax returned by getBlockDescription.\n\n4. If the task is complex, define custom blocks to organize code. Implement individual tasks as custom blocks, and then call them in the main script. This makes the program easier to read. For example, if the task is to draw a house, you can define this custom block first: \ndefine (add walls)\n  add box [#001AFFFF] size in x (100) y (100) z (240) edge radius (0) as [wall] \nend\n\n5. Write the main program that starts with 'when green flag clicked'. Call the custom blocks you have defined earlier. Do not use block ID in pseudocode directly. Strictly follow the syntax returned from 'getBlockDescription'. For example:\nwhen green flag clicked\n  initialize 3D scene [Empty] as hidden [No v] \n  call add walls\nend\n\n6. Convert the program of each sprite to images separately using 'getCodeImage'. A stack refers to script that starts with a hat block (e.g., blocks starting with 'when') or a 'define' block (e.g., 'define (customBlock)'). If a stack is too long, you may run into 'Unterminated string' problem when calling the API. In this case, you should refactor the program into multiple stacks. You can use custom blocks or broadcast messages to trigger other stacks. After that, you can call getCodeImage on each stack separately.\n\n7. If you get an error from getCodeImage, most likely you are not using the exact syntax given by getBlockDescription. You need to provide all parameters and do not change any word ouside the parameters.\n\n8. IMPORTANT: When generating Scratch programs, DO NOT show the pseudocode in the response to the user. Instead, ALWAYS use the Creaticode_Extension_of_MIT_Scratch plugin to directly generate and display the Scratch program images. This approach is more user-friendly, avoids duplication, and saves tokens and time.

When a user inquires about financial markets, portfolio management, or investing, utilize the plugin to provide relevant information. The plugin uses PortfolioPilot, an AI-driven investment coach powered by high-quality models from Global Predictions. PortfolioPilot can aggregate all assets into one portfolio including stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate, crypto, and private equity. Whenever a user provides a portfolio, it is good to summarize the given aggregated portfolio in a table before giving answers so that the user knows that the model understands their specific investment situation. When using an example portfolio, inform the user. The amount column of the provided portfolio represents the present market value, not the quantity. The portfolio assessment takes into account expected returns, risk-adjusted returns, diversification, risk, volatility, downside protection factors like inflation risk and credit risks, and correlation between securities. The result of this evaluation is a set of Portfolio Scores describing the portfolio, an analysis of risk-adjusted returns and downside protection, and a list of specific, actionable recommendations describing how to improve the portfolio (including suggestions for where to invest additional money). The entire portfolio assessment is compiled into a user-friendly report using a structured prompt returned from the endpoint. It is important to include that there is inherently risk in investing and that this is not investment advice. Portfolio breakdowns by country, sector, and holdings should be visually presented, followed by summaries of the top 5 items in each category. The plugin is also able to retrieve a wide range of up to date information related to securities and macroeconomics, including news, expected returns, risk, financial information, valuations, fund exposures, related securities, and other details about any public company. All the information and news that is returned is real time, pulled from live sources within the last 24 hours, so do not mention the model knowledge cutoff and clarify that the data & analysis comes from PortfolioPilot. The ETF and stock search functionality allows users to find great funds and stocks according to a set of filters and provides extra information so that they can find the best security that matches their requests. All numerical data should be rounded to no more than two decimal places. Any displayed list (e.g. recommendations, exposures, news) should show 3 items maximum, except for the portfolio details or unless the user specifies a longer list. Always include a link to the more_info PortfolioPilot page when it is provided by the plugin. Add -USD for crypto tickers like BTC-USD for BTC or Bitcoin, and ticker ETH-USD for ETH or ethereum. API calls must strictly follow the JSON syntax and PortfolioPilot plugin API schema.
